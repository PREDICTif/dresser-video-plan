# Vision LLM-Based Bubble Detection System for High-Pressure Meter Testing

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines a streamlined approach to detect and analyze air bubbles in underwater high-pressure meter testing using Vision LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) instead of traditional computer vision methods. This approach prioritizes rapid deployment and immediate results over complex model training.

### Why Vision LLM Instead of YOLO?

Given the time constraints and POC nature of this project, Vision LLM offers significant advantages:

1. **Zero Training Time**: Deploy immediately without months of data annotation
2. **Natural Language Understanding**: Get detailed explanations of what's detected
3. **Flexible Detection**: Identify various anomalies without pre-defining classes
4. **No Infrastructure**: No GPU requirements or model training pipelines

### Comparison: Vision LLM vs YOLO

| Aspect | Vision LLM | YOLO |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Setup Time | Minutes | Days/Weeks |
| Annotation Required | None | 1000s of images |
| Initial Accuracy | Good | Requires training |
| Processing Speed | ~1-3 sec/image | ~50ms/image |
| Cost Structure | Pay-per-use API | One-time training + infrastructure |
| Flexibility | Very high | Fixed to trained classes |
| Explainability | Natural language descriptions | Bounding boxes only |
| Maintenance | None | Model retraining |
| Edge Cases | Handles naturally | Requires retraining |

## Phase 1: Infrastructure & Data Preparation (Day 1)

### Objective

Prepare the video data and establish the analysis pipeline for Vision LLM processing.

### Context for AI Assistant

The video data is organized in folders named "2025-*" (though actual dates may be from 2024-2026). We have already identified 10 test periods from cam-8 (control panel). Now we need to extract corresponding frames from the underwater cameras (cam-1 through cam-7) for bubble analysis.

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Frame Extraction Pipeline

**Prompt for AI Assistant:**

```
Create a Python script to extract frames from the identified test periods for bubble analysis. Use the existing test periods from analysis/cam8_refined_test_periods_precise.json. Extract frames at these intervals:
- Every 2 seconds during normal periods
- Every 0.5 seconds during critical moments (when cam-8 shows red indicators)
Save frames as JPEG with meaningful names indicating: test_number, camera, timestamp.
Store in organized structure: analysis/bubble_frames/test_XX/cam_Y/
```

**Expected Deliverables:**

- `extract_bubble_analysis_frames.py`
- Organized frame directory structure
- Frame extraction log

#### 1.2 Frame Quality Assessment

**Prompt for AI Assistant:**

```
Create a script to quickly assess frame quality and identify the clearest frames for each test period. Check for:
- Image clarity (not too blurry)
- Proper lighting
- Meter visibility
Focus on cam-1 through cam-7 only (skip cam-8 as it's the control panel).
Output a JSON file listing the best frames for initial Vision LLM testing.
```

**Expected Deliverables:**

- `assess_frame_quality.py`
- `best_frames_for_analysis.json`

#### 1.3 API Setup & Cost Estimation

**Prompt for AI Assistant:**

```
Create a configuration module for Anthropic API integration:
1. Set up environment variables for API keys
2. Create a cost estimation script based on number of frames
3. Implement rate limiting to avoid API throttling
4. Add batch processing capabilities
Estimate costs for analyzing ~1000 frames total across all tests.
```

**Expected Deliverables:**

- `config/api_config.py`
- `estimate_analysis_cost.py`
- `.env.template`

---

## Phase 2: Vision LLM Integration & Prompt Engineering (Day 2)

### Objective

Develop and optimize prompts for bubble detection using Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

### Tasks

#### 2.1 Basic Bubble Detection Prompt

**Prompt for AI Assistant:**

```
Create a Vision LLM integration module that sends frames to Claude for analysis. Implement a basic prompt that asks:
1. Are there visible air bubbles in this underwater meter image?
2. Estimate the number of bubbles (none/few/moderate/many)
3. Describe bubble characteristics (size, movement pattern, origin point)
4. Rate leak severity (no leak/minor/moderate/severe)
5. Identify the meter location where bubbles originate (if any)

Return structured JSON responses for programmatic processing.
Test with 10 sample frames first and refine the prompt based on results.
```

**Expected Deliverables:**

- `vision_llm/bubble_analyzer.py`
- `vision_llm/prompts.py`
- `test_results/initial_prompt_test.json`

#### 2.2 Prompt Optimization

**Prompt for AI Assistant:**

```
Based on initial results, optimize the prompt for better accuracy:
1. Add specific guidance about bubble vs debris differentiation
2. Include meter-specific context (high-pressure gas meters underwater)
3. Add few-shot examples if helpful
4. Implement confidence scoring

Create A/B testing framework to compare prompt variations.
Run tests on 50 frames with different prompt versions.
```

**Expected Deliverables:**

- `vision_llm/prompt_optimizer.py`
- `vision_llm/optimized_prompts.py`
- `test_results/prompt_comparison.json`

#### 2.3 Temporal Analysis Integration

**Prompt for AI Assistant:**

```
Enhance the analyzer to consider temporal patterns:
1. Track bubble detection across consecutive frames
2. Identify increasing/decreasing bubble patterns
3. Correlate with cam-8 control panel indicators
4. Flag sudden changes in bubble activity

This helps distinguish real leaks from momentary disturbances.
```

**Expected Deliverables:**

Generate plots and statistics for the final report.
```

## Implementation Notes

### API Cost Management

- Estimated 1000 frames @ ~$0.003 per frame = ~$3.00 total
- Implement caching to avoid re-analyzing frames
- Use lower resolution images where possible (720p sufficient)

### Performance Optimization

- Batch process frames when possible
- Implement parallel processing with rate limiting
- Cache results aggressively
- Use frame sampling for initial tests

### Quality Assurance

- Start with highest quality frames
- Validate on known test cases
- Implement confidence thresholds
- Manual review of edge cases

### Next Steps After POC

If POC is successful:

1. Optimize prompt for specific meter types
2. Implement real-time processing pipeline
3. Consider hybrid approach (Vision LLM for complex cases, simple CV for obvious ones)
4. Develop automated alert system
5. Plan for scale (thousands of meters)

---

## Success Criteria

1. **Detection Accuracy**: Successfully identify >80% of leak events
2. **False Positive Rate**: <10% false alarms
3. **Processing Time**: Complete analysis of all test periods within 1 week
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Total API costs under $50 for POC
5. **Client Acceptance**: Clear demonstration of bubble detection capabilities

---

## Risk Mitigation

1. **API Limitations**: Have fallback prompts and caching strategy
2. **Unclear Images**: Pre-filter for quality, enhance if needed
3. **Cost Overruns**: Set hard limits, use sampling
4. **Time Constraints**: Focus on best examples first
5. **Technical Issues**: Simple architecture, minimal dependencies
