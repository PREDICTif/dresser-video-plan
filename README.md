# Vision LLM Bubble Detection Plan

This directory contains the streamlined plan for implementing bubble detection using Vision LLM (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) instead of traditional computer vision methods.

## Documents Overview

### 1. [Executive Summary](executive_summary.md)

- High-level overview for stakeholders
- Why Vision LLM over YOLO
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Expected outcomes and ROI

### 2. [Vision LLM Bubble Detection Plan](vision_llm_bubble_detection_plan.md)

- Complete implementation plan
- Phase-by-phase breakdown
- Detailed task descriptions
- Prompts for AI assistant implementation

### 3. [Technical Implementation Guide](technical_implementation_guide.md)

- Code examples for each phase
- API integration details
- Batch processing implementation
- Report generation scripts

## Quick Start

1. **Read the Executive Summary** for a high-level understanding
2. **Review the main plan** for phase-by-phase implementation
3. **Use the technical guide** for specific code implementations

## Key Benefits of This Approach

- **Zero Training Required**: Start analyzing immediately
- **Natural Language Output**: Get explanations, not just detections
- **Rapid POC**: 1-2 weeks instead of months
- **Low Cost**: <$50 for complete proof of concept

## Implementation Timeline

```
Week 1:
├── Day 1-2: Frame extraction and preparation
├── Day 3-4: Vision LLM integration
└── Day 5: Initial testing and prompt optimization

Week 2:
├── Day 1-2: Full analysis of all test periods
├── Day 3: Validation and statistics
└── Day 4-5: Report generation and demo system
```

## For Developers

Each phase includes specific prompts that can be given to an AI coding assistant (like Claude) to implement the required functionality. The technical guide provides working code examples that can be adapted to your specific needs.

## Questions?

This plan is designed to be self-contained and executable by an AI assistant. Simply provide the relevant phase instructions to your coding assistant and follow the implementation steps.
